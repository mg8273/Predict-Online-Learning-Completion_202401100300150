AI model for predicting the chances of student completing a given course

# Online Learning Completion Predictor

A Python implementation of a machine learning model to predict whether students will complete an online course based on their engagement metrics.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of high dropout rates in online education by predicting which students are likely to complete a course. Using behavioral data (videos watched, assignments submitted, and forum participation), the model identifies patterns that correlate with successful course completion.

This implementation provides:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Feature importance analysis
- Decision boundary visualization
- A prediction function for new student data
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-learning-predictor.git
cd online-learning-predictor
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
python predict_completion.py
```

### Input Data Format

The program expects a CSV file with the following columns:
- `videos_watched`: Number of instructional videos viewed by the student
- `assignments_submitted`: Number of assignments completed
- `forum_posts`: Number of forum posts made
- `completed`: Whether the student completed the course (yes/no)

Example:
```
videos_watched,assignments_submitted,forum_posts,completed
11,6,5,yes
43,1,11,no
37,1,8,no
```

### Prediction Function

To use the trained model for predictions on new data:

```python
from predict_completion import predict_completion

# Predict for a new student
result, probability = predict_completion(
    videos=25,
    assignments=5,
    forum_posts=10
)

print(f"Completion prediction: {result}")
print(f"Completion probability: {probability:.2f}")
```

## Model Details

### Feature Engineering

The model uses three key behavioral indicators:
1. **Videos Watched**: Measures content consumption
2. **Assignments Submitted**: Measures active participation
3. **Forum Posts**: Measures community engagement

### Algorithm Selection

The implementation compares three algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Linear classifier that provides feature coefficients
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Easily interpretable results

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble of decision trees that capture complex relationships
   - Provides feature importance measurements
   - Robust against overfitting

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Finds optimal decision boundary
   - Handles non-linear relationships using kernel methods
   - Effective for various data distributions

### Performance Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Hold-out test set (30% of data)
- Standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves

## Example Results

Feature Importance:
```
Feature               Importance
----------------------------------------
assignments_submitted  0.48
videos_watched         0.32
forum_posts            0.20
```

Example Predictions:
```
Student who watched 40 videos, submitted 7 assignments, and made 15 forum posts:
Prediction: yes
Completion probability: 0.89

Student who watched 5 videos, submitted 1 assignment, and made 2 forum posts:
Prediction: no
Completion probability: 0.08
```

## Visualizations

The program generates several visualizations:
- Feature distributions by completion status
- Feature correlation heatmap
- Feature importance bar chart
- Decision boundary plot
- Confusion matrix

## Limitations

- Performance depends on the quality and amount of training data
- The model assumes a consistent relationship between behavior and completion
- Real-world implementation would benefit from additional features (time spent, session frequency, etc.)
- Current implementation doesn't account for temporal dynamics (early vs. late course behavior)

## Future Improvements

- Time-series analysis of student engagement
- Additional features (quiz scores, time spent on platform)
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Different model architectures (Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting)
- Deployment as a web application for real-time predictions
- Integration with intervention systems
